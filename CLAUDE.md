# Context
This is a higher order repo with several other repositories as git submodules

for a large intro please see [the README](./README.md) 

If you are just rearing to go, then go ahead and assume that we have the cli installed and working so you can check next actions with `

Otherwise the other context stands, we are here for quality not quantity, so take your time, read the docs and specifications, dont be afraid to ask questions, make suggestions, and even make mistakes.

Together, i know we can create something that neither could do alone, but as the system grows, it is important that clear communication guides our way forward and that we are implementing changes at the various levels they may be needed.
