[ ] Support alias syntax for action files $ in order to make references more human-readable we want to implement some form of syntax to easily reference action files using aliases. This will help in reducing the complexity of file paths and make the codebase more maintainable. ^2026-01-10T13:37 #019ba9d8-3595-7850-805c-9af083dd975b
[ ] Implement ontology-based validation in the linter $ now that we have the context.json file set up, we can leverage this to give even more succinct and accurate linting errors, especially those involving child or dependency chains ^2026-01-10T13:38 #019ba9d9-082d-7460-ab91-1887c19b9bc6
[ ] Get Sync Server working $ A core usecase is working from other computers including a phone and to do that we need to get our sync server implementation working with the ability to easily sync a list of actions between devices so that we can accomodate all forms of connections !1 ^2026-01-10T13:40 #019ba9da-2770-7380-9f40-923cbaa5302e
[ ] Move to a model where we can place the due/do date OR the RRULE $ i realize now that having the RRUL as an optional rider is confusing because you still need to give the time you need to do something so we are just placing it in two places instead i think something either is or isnt a recurring action and instead what we do is have the hiearchy work for us and make it so that child actions are included in recurring actions ^2026-01-10T13:42 #019ba9dc-695c-71a2-9351-f561fea82e3b
